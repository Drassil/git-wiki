# Welcome to git-wiki demo

This is both documentation and [demo](Demo.md) of git-wiki.

it's a **modular and full featured wiki** powered by git, github & [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/drassil/git-wiki/)  pages and pull-requests!

## Getting started (WIP)

The easier and faster way to use git-wiki is the "skeleton" method.

Simply clone [this repo](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-skeleton) or click on "Use this template" button to create your copy of 
the skeleton project.

Edit _config.yml and other pages as you need and then deploy it on github pages.

For more installation options see the [Installation instructions](#installation-instructions)

## Features 

* Improvements in the **cooperative** aspect: forks, pull-requests and roles.
* You can **customize your wiki** as you want with style sheets and even changing the layout. (see customization section below) 
* **No databases!** Only static files that can be downloaded in a few seconds.
* **Blazing fast** and free thankfully to Github Pages and Jekyll Server Side Generation process!
* **Markdown and html** mixed together!
* **Multiple free search engines!** on a static site!
* **History, revision comparison** and everything you need from a wiki platform.
* You can **edit your pages** with the standard git editor, prose.io (integrated) or any kind of editor you prefer.
* Non-existent wiki page links are "[red](red.md)", you can **click on them to automatically create a new page**!
* [External links](http://www.google.it) get the right icon automatically
* **Component system with hooks** that allows you to totally customize your wiki UI. (see customization section below) 
* Some **nice internal themes** to change your entire wiki UI with 1 simple configuration (see customization section below)
* Integrated **Blogging** feature thanks to jekyll!
* You can download the entire wiki for **offline** usage and even navigate directly using a markdown reader

You can use it with jekyll ["remote_theme"](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) feature or fork/copy the master branch  and start your wiki in just 1 minute*.

Git-wiki can be used as [theme for jekyll](https://jekyll-themes.com/git-wiki/)

 *Github pages takes about 10 minutes to show up the first time you configure it

**Note:**
You can even include the [official github wiki](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/) as a submodule and enable the option in our conf file to use github wiki pages in git-wiki system, but it's an experimental feature and it implies less advantages and greater disadvantages for now.
